"""micro-rag — retrieval-augmented generation, small enough to trust.

Lab 10 of Advanced Databases for Data Science (DS 6XXX, Fall 2026).
Runs on Lab 9's microvector (reference ships in this folder).

The pipeline, one function per stage:

    chunk_corpus()   documents -> chunks              (provided)
    embed(text)      text -> 2048-dim unit vector     (provided; see note)
    Retriever        chunks -> index -> top-k         (YOUR JOB)
    build_prompt()   question + chunks -> a prompt    (YOUR JOB)
    answer()         prompt -> text                   (provided; offline echo
                                                       mode, or a real LLM via
                                                       LLM_BASE_URL/KEY/MODEL)

EMBEDDING NOTE, read this: real systems use a learned sentence-embedding
model. This lab uses hashed bag-of-words — each word hashes to a dimension,
counts get tf-scaled, the vector is normalized. It is deterministic,
offline, and honest about being the weakest link: words shared between
question and chunk drive similarity, synonyms don't. The RETRIEVAL
machinery above it is exactly what you'd run under a real model (and your
project will, with this file as the skeleton).

Run the tests any time:   python3 test_rag.py
Talk to it:               python3 ask.py "why do databases read whole blocks?"

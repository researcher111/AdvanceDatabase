"""Lab 10, Part 4: the same pipeline on 4,000 real abstracts. Run after the
tests pass:  python3 measure_real.py   (about 30 s: pure Python over 4,000 x 2048)

Parts 1 to 3 used a 24-document corpus about this course, small enough to judge
by eye. This script points YOUR Retriever at 4,000 real arXiv abstracts (the
papers Lab 9 embedded) and compares two embedders on them:

    hashed     your micro_rag.embed(): a hashed bag of words, no model
    MiniLM     a real sentence-embedding model (all-MiniLM-L6-v2), whose
               vectors for every abstract and every question ship precomputed
               in data/, so no download or GPU is needed

Three views: what each embedder retrieves for the same question; how much
the two agree; and a labeled mini-eval, ten questions written to paraphrase
one specific paper without reusing its title words, scored with hit@3 and MRR.

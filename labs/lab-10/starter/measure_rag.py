"""Lab 10 measurement — run AFTER test_rag.py passes:  python3 measure_rag.py

Three exhibits:

    1. The DIM sweep — shrink the embedding and watch retrieval collapse
       as hash collisions merge unrelated words onto shared dimensions.
    2. The eval table — every question, what came back, at what rank.
    3. The synonym wall — the same information need phrased with matching
       vs. mismatched vocabulary. Bag-of-words has no idea "popular pages
       in memory" means "buffer pool". This failure is WHY learned
       embedding models exist; your project swaps one in.

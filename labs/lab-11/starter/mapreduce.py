"""micro-mapreduce — the pattern under Spark, in 60 lines you write.

Lab 11 of Advanced Databases for Data Science (DS 6XXX, Fall 2026).
Part A of three; pure standard library, fully offline.

THE PATTERN: MapReduce separates per-record work from per-key aggregation:

    map      each input record -> zero or more (key, value) pairs
             processes one record independently
    shuffle  route every pair to the partition its KEY hashes to,
             then group values by key inside each partition  (the network cost)
    reduce   each (key, [values]) -> one result
             runs per key, sees ALL values for that key

The shuffle is the whole trick: hash partitioning guarantees every pair
with the same key lands in the same partition, so reduce never needs to
talk to another partition. That guarantee is what you implement today.

This file runs the phases sequentially in one process. A distributed engine
also needs serialization, scheduling, retries, and a partition function
whose configuration agrees across workers. Python's string hash is stable
within a run, but separately launched processes can use different seeds.

The corpus is 4,000 real arXiv abstracts (corpus.py), the papers Lab 9 embedded.

Run the tests any time:   python3 test_sparkray.py

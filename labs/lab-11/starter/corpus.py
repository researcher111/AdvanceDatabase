"""Lab 10 — the corpus: this course, as documents. Provided complete.

24 short documents summarizing DS 6XXX topics — so you can judge retrieval
quality yourself (you took the class the corpus describes). Each doc has an
id, a title, and a few sentences.

EVAL holds 12 questions with the doc ids a correct retrieval should
surface. Your retriever is scored on hit@3 and MRR against them.

DOCS = [
    ("blocks", "Blocks and pages",
     "Disks move data in fixed-size blocks because a storage trip costs the same "
     "regardless of size. microdb uses 4 KB blocks; a page is the in-memory copy of a "
     "block. Block number k of a file begins at byte k times the block size. "
     "Reading whole blocks makes neighboring data nearly free to fetch."),
    ("fsync", "Durability and fsync",
     "A normal write only reaches the operating system's cache; fsync forces bytes to "
     "durable storage and costs ten to a thousand times more. Databases ration fsync "
     "carefully. Lab 1 measured buffered versus durable writes per second, and the "
     "ratio motivates the entire design of transaction logging."),
    ("bufferpool", "The buffer pool",
     "The buffer pool is the database's own cache: fixed frames each holding one "
     "block, with a pin and unpin protocol so pages in use are never evicted. LRU "
     "chooses eviction victims by recency. Databases build their own pool rather "
     "than trusting the OS cache because they need pinning and control over write "
     "ordering for recovery."),
    ("cliff", "The sequential flooding cliff",
     "A sequential scan through an LRU pool one frame smaller than the file achieves "
     "a zero percent hit rate: each block is evicted just before it is needed again. "
     "Real engines defend with ring buffers or midpoint insertion. Hot-set workloads, "
     "whose working set fits the pool, hit above ninety percent."),
    ("slots", "Record slots and layout",
     "Rows live in fixed-size slots: a four-byte in-use flag then fields at offsets "
     "computed from the schema. Fixed slots make addressing arithmetic, updates "
     "in-place, and deletes a flag flip. The waste inside reserved space is internal "
     "fragmentation, the deliberate rent paid for O(1) access."),
    ("tombstone", "Tombstones and deletion",
     "Deleting a record flips its flag to empty and moves nothing; the old bytes "
     "linger until an insert reuses the slot. This makes deletion cheap and deleted "
     "data forensically recoverable, and it is why databases need vacuum or "
     "compaction processes to reclaim space."),
    ("rid", "Record identifiers",
     "A RID is a row's physical address: block number and slot number. Because "
     "slotted storage never moves records, RIDs stay valid indefinitely, which is "
     "what makes indexes safe: an index is a map from field values to RIDs."),
    ("catalog", "The system catalog",
     "The catalog stores every table's schema and layout in ordinary tables like "
     "field_catalog. The catalog's own layout is hardcoded at startup to break the "
     "circular dependency, a move called bootstrapping. In Postgres the psql "
     "backslash-d command is just a catalog query."),
    ("iterator", "The iterator model",
     "Every query operator implements the same interface: before_first, next, "
     "get_val, close. Operators wrap each other into plans; rows flow up on demand "
     "one at a time, so memory tracks plan depth rather than data size. Sort and "
     "group-by are the exceptions that must materialize."),
    ("product", "Products and joins",
     "A join is a cartesian product filtered by a predicate. The nested-loop "
     "product rewinds its right input for every left row, so pairing costs the "
     "product of the table sizes. Hash joins and merge joins exist to avoid "
     "building pairs that will be discarded."),
    ("pushdown", "Predicate pushdown",
     "Filtering each input before a join instead of filtering joined pairs "
     "afterward can cut work by orders of magnitude with an identical answer, "
     "guaranteed by relational algebra. The same idea reaches into Parquet files "
     "as chunk skipping and across clusters in distributed engines."),
    ("parsing", "Parsing SQL",
     "A lexer turns characters into tokens; a recursive-descent parser turns tokens "
     "into a description, one method per grammar rule using peek, next, match, and "
     "expect. Parsing to plain data lets the planner be a separate, swappable "
     "stage, and expect() produces helpful errors by construction."),
    ("planner", "Planning and naivety",
     "The naive planner builds table scans, folds products left to right, then adds "
     "one select and one project. It is always correct and often slow, because it "
     "never pushes filters down; doing that safely requires knowing which fields "
     "each term references and how many rows will survive."),
    ("btree", "B+ trees",
     "A B+ tree keeps sorted keys in leaves linked left to right, with internal "
     "nodes holding routing keys. A full node splits at its middle key, which is "
     "copied up from a leaf or moved up from an internal node; the root splitting "
     "grows the tree and keeps every leaf at the same depth. Fan-out around two "
     "hundred makes a hundred-million-row tree four levels tall."),
    ("selectivity", "Selectivity and index choice",
     "Selectivity is the fraction of rows a predicate keeps. Indexes shine on "
     "selective predicates like an equality on a unique id and lose to a plain "
     "scan on unselective ones, where random jumps cost more than one smooth read. "
     "Optimizers estimate selectivity from statistics to choose."),
    ("wal", "Write-ahead logging",
     "Before changing a page, the database writes the old value to an append-only "
     "log; the log record must reach disk before the changed page can. Commit "
     "flushes data pages then fsyncs a commit record: that single fsync is the "
     "moment a transaction becomes durable."),
    ("recovery", "Crash recovery",
     "Recovery reads the log newest first, so each transaction's fate is known "
     "before its writes are encountered. Writes of unfinished transactions are "
     "undone by restoring old values. Recovery must be idempotent because a crash "
     "can interrupt recovery itself; rollback receipts make reruns skip cleanly."),
    ("locks", "Two-phase locking",
     "Shared locks allow many readers; exclusive locks allow one writer and no "
     "readers. Strict two-phase locking holds all locks until commit, which "
     "guarantees serializability and prevents dirty reads, at the price of "
     "waiting and deadlocks, which engines break by aborting a victim."),
    ("mvcc", "Multi-version concurrency control",
     "Updates create new row versions instead of overwriting; each reader sees a "
     "snapshot of versions committed when it began. Readers never block writers "
     "and writers never block readers. Vacuum reclaims versions no snapshot can "
     "see. Postgres stamps versions with xmin and xmax transaction ids."),
    ("columnar", "Columnar storage",
     "Analytics touches all rows but few columns, so column stores keep each "
     "column's values contiguous: queries read only named columns, and runs of "
     "same-typed values compress with run-length and dictionary encoding. Row "
     "stores win point lookups; column stores win scans."),
    ("parquet", "Parquet and partitioning",
     "Parquet stores columns in chunks with min-max statistics so engines skip "
     "data without reading it. Hive partitioning puts the partition column in "
     "folder names like month equals twelve, letting a filter skip whole "
     "directories. DuckDB reports scanning one of twelve files."),
    ("vectors", "Vector search and IVF",
     "Embeddings turn similarity into geometry: nearest neighbors by cosine. "
     "Exact search compares against everything; IVF clusters vectors with k-means "
     "and probes only the lists nearest the query. The probe parameter trades "
     "recall against comparisons, and recall at k measures what fraction of true "
     "neighbors were found."),
    ("warehouse", "Cloud warehouses",
     "Cloud warehouses separate storage from compute: data rests in object "
     "storage while query clusters spin up on demand and bill by bytes scanned. "
     "Naming only needed columns and partitioning on filtered keys directly "
     "reduces cost, because the columnar lessons become line items."),
    ("lakehouse", "The lakehouse",
     "A lakehouse adds a transactional metadata layer such as Delta or Iceberg "
     "over Parquet files in object storage: a manifest records which files form "
     "the table, enabling ACID commits, schema evolution, and time travel. "
     "Structurally it is a catalog plus a log conferring table-hood on a lake."),

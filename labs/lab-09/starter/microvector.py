"""microvector — a vector index you can hold in your head.

Lab 9 of Advanced Databases for Data Science (DS 6XXX, Fall 2026).
Pure standard library; vectors are plain Python lists.

THE PROBLEM: given a query vector, find the k most similar stored vectors.
Exact search compares against ALL of them - O(n) dot products per query.
The fix is the same shape as week 6's: a structure that lets you skip most
of the data. Here it's IVF (inverted file) - cluster the vectors, search
only the clusters nearest the query:

    build:  k-means the vectors into C cluster lists (coarse "buckets")
    search: find the P nearest cluster centroids ("probe" P lists),
            then brute-force only inside those lists

    exact recall costs n comparisons; IVF costs ~ C + P*(n/C)
    - and pays for it in RECALL: the true neighbor might live in a
    list you didn't probe. recall@k measures how often it doesn't.

Everything here scales to the real thing: FAISS's IndexIVFFlat and
pgvector's ivfflat are this file with SIMD and better k-means.

Run the tests any time:   python3 test_vector.py
Run the measurement:      python3 measure_recall.py    (after tests pass)

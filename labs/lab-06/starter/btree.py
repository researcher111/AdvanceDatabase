"""microdb · part 6 — the B+ tree index.

Lab 6 of Advanced Databases for Data Science (DS 6XXX, Fall 2026).
Runs on Labs 1-5 (reference implementations ship in this folder; the
reference TableScan gained move_to_rid() for this lab).

AN INDEX IS A MAP FROM VALUES TO RIDS. This one is the classic:

    - leaves hold (key, rid) pairs in sorted order, linked left-to-right
    - internal nodes hold ordered keys that route a search downward
    - every node holds at most ORDER entries; inserting into a full node
      SPLITS it, pushing its middle key up (growing at the ROOT, which
      is why B+ trees stay balanced for free)

    search(k)  descends height-many nodes:  O(log n)  vs a scan's O(n)
    range(lo, hi)  descends once, then walks the leaf chain

Honest scope note: real engines store each node in a disk page and split
pages (Sciore ch. 12 does it in full). Ours keeps nodes in memory and is
rebuilt at startup — the ALGORITHM is identical, and it indexes real rows
in your real heap file via their RIDs.

Run the tests any time:   python3 test_btree.py
Run the measurement:      python3 measure_index.py     (after tests pass)

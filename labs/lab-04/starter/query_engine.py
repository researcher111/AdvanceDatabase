"""microdb · part 4 — the query engine: scans that stack.

Lab 4 of Advanced Databases for Data Science (DS 6XXX, Fall 2026).
Runs on Labs 1-3 (reference implementations ship in this folder). The
reference TableScan gained two small methods for this lab — get_val()
and has_field() — so every scan in the pipeline speaks one interface.

THE SCAN INTERFACE (duck-typed; every operator implements it):

    before_first()        rewind to before the first row
    next() -> bool        advance to the next row; False when exhausted
    get_val(fld)          value of a field in the current row
    has_field(fld) -> bool
    close()               release everything underneath (pins!)

Because the interface is uniform, operators wrap each other freely:

    ts  = TableScan(bm, fm, "students", layout)          # rows of a table
    sel = SelectScan(ts, Predicate(("gpa", ">", 35)))    # ...that pass a test
    prj = ProjectScan(sel, ["name"])                     # ...only some fields
    while prj.next():
        print(prj.get_val("name"))
    prj.close()

That stack IS a query plan. Rows flow up on demand — nothing is copied,
nothing is materialized, and a terabyte scan still uses one pinned block.

Run the tests any time:   python3 test_scans.py
Run the measurement:      python3 measure_pipeline.py   (after tests pass)
